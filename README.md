# Introduction
This repository contains my personnal notes and questions, that I have managed to answer, related to the general-purpose programming language __JAVA__. These notes will cover __JVA Basics__, __OOP__, __Inheritance__ and much more. This repository is intended to be used as a reminder of JAVA concepts.
1. What is the difference between JDK and JRE?
2. What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
3. What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?
