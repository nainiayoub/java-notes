## Introduction
This repository contains my personnal notes and questions, that I have managed to answer, related to the general-purpose programming language __JAVA__. These notes will cover ___JAVA Basics___, ___OOP___, ___Inheritance___ and much more. This repository is intended to be used as a reminder of JAVA concepts.

## What is the difference between JDK and JRE?

#### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
* The `JRE` is used to run your Java program. It includes the `JVM`, a set of libraries that come with Java as well as `Java Launcher`.
* The `JRE` doesn't include any development tools.
#### JDK (Java Development Kit)
* The `JDK` is the development kit that you need to create Java programs. 
* The `JDK` is basically the tools that will take your Java source code and convert it into a format that the `JRE` and the `JVM` can execute.
* The `JDK` comes bundled with a Java Runtime Edition as shown in the Image above.

## What is Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
<img src="https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c1/overview-fig3.png" alt="Java Virtual Machine"><br/>
* The `JVM` (Java Virtual Machine) is a run-time engine that converts `Java bytecode` _(generated by `the Compiler`)_, thanks to The `Execution engine` into machine code.
* The `JVM` is a part of [Java Runtime Environment (JRE)](#jre-java-runtime-environment), which means that it enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode.
* The `JVM` is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code.
* The `JVM` resides on the RAM.

## What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?
All objects created in Java are stored in `JVM (Java virtual machine)`. JVM memory is basically divided into the following parts:
1. Method Area.
2. Heap Memory.
3. Stack Memory.
4. Program Counter register.
5. Native method Stacks.

## What is JIT compiler?

* The `Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler` is a an essential part of the JRE, that improves the performance of Java applications by compiling platform-neutral Java bytecode into native machine code at run time.
* Without `the JIT`, the JVM has to interpret the bytecodes itself - a process that requires extra CPU and memory.

## How Java platform is different from other platforms?
<img src="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/getStarted/getStarted-jvm.gif" alt="Java platform"><br/>
* Most platforms can be described as a combination of the operating system and underlying hardware. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in that it's a software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.
* The Java platform has two components:
   * [The Java Virtual Machine](#what-is-java-virtual-machine-jvm).
   * The Java Application Programming Interface (API).
   * Java is platform independent (WORA).
   
## Why Java is 'write once and run anywhere' language?
* Java applications are called `WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere)`. This means Java can be developed on any device, compiled into a standard bytecode and be expected to run on any device equipped with a JVM.
*  __Java is portable__, means that you can run Java bytecode on any hardware that has a compliant [JVM (Java Virtual Machine)](#what-is-java-virtual-machine-jvm).
