#### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
* The `JRE` is used to run your Java program. It includes the `JVM`, a set of libraries that come with Java as well as `Java Launcher`.
* The `JRE` doesn't include any development tools.
#### JDK (Java Development Kit)
* The `JDK` is the development kit that you need to create Java programs. 
* The `JDK` is basically the tools that will take your Java source code and convert it into a format that the `JRE` and the `JVM` can execute.
* The `JDK` comes bundled with a Java Runtime Edition as shown in the Image above.
